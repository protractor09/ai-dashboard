AI Tools Used
- Primary tools: ChatGPT, Cursor, Claude
- Key use cases: -> ChatGPT was mainly used for creatig broiler plate code and cursor for most of the frontend development and debuging.
		 -> Mistra-small api was used for the integration of natural language for the creation of visualizations.

Sample Prompts (2-3 examples)
1. "Create a minimal Next.js API web app that allows users to:
		Upload a CSV file.
		Ask for a chart type (line, bar, pie, etc.) and column names for X and Y axes via a simple form.
		Generate and display the requested visualization using libraries like  Chart.js & react-chartjs-2.
    No frontend styling is needed—just a barebones HTML form for upload and inputs, and a page to display the chart. Use minimal code and only necessary dependencies."

2. "Create a minimal React (or Next.js) frontend that:
	Allows users to upload a CSV or xlsx file.
	Reads column names and lets users either select chart type + columns or give a natural language instruction like 'line chart of sales over time'.
	Visualizes the data using Chart.js.
	Important:
	Use the @design.json file strictly for the UI layout and design tokens (colors, font sizes, padding, etc.).
	Do not hardcode styles—read from design.json for all UI components (buttons, input boxes, chart container).
	Keep the UI minimal but functional with no extra styling outside of design.json.
	Create components for:
		FileUpload (handles CSV parsing)	
		ChartDisplay (renders selected chart)
		InstructionInput (text input for natural language to chart mapping)."

AI vs Manual Work Split
-AI-generated: ~50% (Chart.js configuration, data table setup, boilerplate React components, ESLint/TS fixes).
-Manual coding: ~50% (Mistral API integration, AI route implementation, metrics computation, file upload parsing, and full dashboard logic).
-Customization: Added dark/light theme toggle, chart data mapping, and production-ready Next.js configuration.
Note: The Mistral AI API implementation and integration logic were done entirely by me without AI assistance.
